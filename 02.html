  <!-- The basic "anatomy" of a web page is broken down into two -->
  <!-- parts: the head, and the body. Generally, the             -->
  <!-- differentiation between the two sections is that the head -->
  <!-- contains information for the browser while the body       -->
  <!-- contains information for the user.                        -->
  <!--                                                           -->
  <!-- In your "index.html" page, add opening and closing head   -->
  <!-- and body tags. They should look like the two tags below   -->
  <!-- this comment.                                             -->
  <!--                                                           -->
  <!-- Note that the html, head, and body tags need opening and  -->
  <!-- closing tags so the browser will know when to start and   -->
  <!-- stop processing the content the developer wants it to.    -->
  <!--                                                           -->
  <!-- Refresh your index.html page in the browser. You should   -->
  <!-- not notice any difference because your document does not  -->
  <!-- contain any content yet.                                  -->
